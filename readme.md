##Getting Data About Artists https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-echo-nest-api/

The Echo Nest API provides methods to return a wide range of data about artists. As well as basic profile information and statistics like familiarity, years active, Twitter handle, and links to official sites. Here is an example of a typically useful call that you can make to the Echo Nest API to get artistâ€™s location:

	http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/artist/profile?api_key={echonest_api_key}&id=spotify:artist:5l8VQNuIg0turYE1VtM9zV&format=json&bucket=artist_location
and here is the response:

	{
	  "response": {
	    "status": {
	      "version": "4.2",
	      "code": 0,
	      "message": "Success"
	    },
	    "artist": {
